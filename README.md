# Device Failure Prediction
This is a project assigned to me during [theDevMasters](https://www.thedevmasters.com) bootcamp.<br> 

## Introduction
Requesting to fix already broken devices is costly and time consuming. However, constant service calls also have a negative cost impact on a company. With machine learning, device failure can be predicted, leading to cost savings.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict which devices will fail.

## Metric 
A cost function was used as the evaluation metric for this project. The optimal threshold was chosen based on the highest savings.

## Approach
The following steps were taken to complete the project:
1. Import libraries and dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Feature Engineering
5. Feature Selection
6. Data Wrangling
7. Base Scores Model Evaluation
8. Hyperparameter Tuning
9. Model Selection
10. Cost Function

## Model Selection
Four models were trained through three methods:
1. No Sampling
2. Undersampling
3. Oversampling

The model was chosen based on the highest Average Precision score.



## Technologies
Application: Jupyter Notebook<br>
Programming Language: Python 3.7.4<br>
Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imblearn<br>
